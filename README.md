# BCS Marketing
It all started with an irritated high schooler.

"BCS Marketing" was originally developed in 2019 under the development title "Predator."

"I (JacobBorgProgramming) started the project because I was done with mainstream digital marketing methods and platforms. The mainstream platforms take advantage of users by stealing their data and tracking them everywhere they go. I hated this. So, I started to develop a privacy-by-design marketing platform to provide an alternative to the mainstream platforms and technologies."

This platform does utilize view tracking, but not user tracking.
The only information that is recorded, is when an ad is viewed, when the ad is clicked on, and the generic region the ad was seen in. All of this is collected ANONOMOUSLY!

The platform also features flat-rate pricing ($10 for a week long ad).
